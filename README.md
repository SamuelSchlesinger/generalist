# Generalist ü§ñ

A powerful command-line generalist command-line agent powered by Claude AI and Firecrawl, with 17 built-in tools and a focus on safety and transparency.

## Quick Start

1. **Create your config file** `~/.generalist.env`:
   ```bash
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-firecrawl-api-key
   ```

2. **Run the generalist**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

3. **Start chatting!** Try these examples:
   - "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
   - "Calculate 25 * 4"
   - "Search Wikipedia for Rust programming"
   - "List files in the current directory"

## Key Features

- **üõ†Ô∏è 17 Built-in Tools** - Everything from file operations to web scraping
- **üîê Permission System** - You control what tools can run
- **üíæ Save Conversations** - Resume chats later with `/save` and `/load`
- **üé® Beautiful UI** - See exactly what the generalist is doing in real-time

## Available Tools

## Permission System

When the generalist wants to use a tool, you'll see:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Tool Permission Request
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Tool: bash
Description: Execute a bash command
Input: {"command": "ls -la"}

Allow this tool to execute?
> Yes (always allow this tool)
  Yes (just this once)
  No (never allow this tool)
  No (just this once)
```

Your choices are remembered during the session.

## Commands

- `/save [name]` - Save conversation
- `/load` - Load conversation
- `/model` - Change Claude model
- `/help` - Show help
- `exit` - Quit

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuelSchlesinger/generalist.git
cd generalist
cargo build --release
./target/release/generalist
```

### As a Library

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
claude = "0.1.0"
```

## Basic Library Usage

```rust
use claude::{Claude, ToolRegistry, tools::*};
use std::sync::Arc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = Claude::new(
        std::env::var("CLAUDE_API_KEY")?, 
        "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest".to_string()
    );
    
    let mut registry = ToolRegistry::new();
    registry.register(Arc::new(CalculatorTool))?;
    
    let response = client.run_conversation_turn(
        "What's 25 * 4?",
        &mut registry,
        None,
        None,
        None,
    ).await?;
    
    // Print response
    Ok(())
}
```

## Historical Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from pioneering AI systems that established foundational problem-solving methodologies:

- **General Problem Solver (GPS)** - Developed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon (1957), GPS introduced means-ends analysis as a systematic approach to problem solving, breaking down complex problems by identifying differences between current and goal states.
- **STRIPS** - The Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (1971) advanced automated planning with operator-based state space search.
- **SHRDLU** - Terry Winograd's natural language understanding system (1970) demonstrated sophisticated reasoning about goals and actions in constrained domains.

The generalist agent architecture continues this tradition by implementing means-ends analysis with modern AI capabilities and a rich set of tools for real-world problem solving.
